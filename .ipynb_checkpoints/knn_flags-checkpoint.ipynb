    "1a) Mahattan distance is relatively appropriate since the data set consists high dimensionality of features. Cosine distance is less appropriate since Cosine distance measures the similarites between data points and forsakes the information conveyed through the magnitute of data. In this data set, majority of features are categorial or binary, whereas distance functions we adopted are more suitable for measureing numerical features, and cosine distance might not capture information conveyed by features such as landmass and population.\n",
    "\n",
    "1b) Hamming distance would be a beter choise over Euclidean distance. Since the data set consists a large number of features that are represented in a binary format, and Euclidean distance is not suitable for this data set due to its high dimentionaliy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Weighted KNN should outperform the Majority voing version. Weighted KNN gives neighbours closer to the test instance more relavance to avoid the situation where the test instance is significantly close to a neighbour from one class but being outnumbered by other neighbours with farther distance from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Type code for 3.(a) in the cell below, and answer 3.(b) below*\n",
    "\n",
    "3b) The prediction from KNN with k=5 and majority voting tends to prefer classes that contain a large number of instances in the data set. In this case, class \"red\" are the majority among the data set. With majority voting, it is expected that the KNN will choose the class with more neighbours for each test instance, therefore the \"red\" class stands out with most occurrence, causing the discrepancies. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Accuracy works best when the all classes in the data set are balanced, that is all classes should share similiar percentage of amount in the data set. In this data set, classes are quite imbalanced since there are some colours significantly dominates other colours in terms of number of instances. Therefore, accuracy may not be an appropriate metric for this data set. \n"
